Marcus Jackson's Portfolio Website

This repository contains the front-end code for my professional portfolio and resume. It is designed to showcase my technical skills, experience, and academic background in a clean, professional, and visually appealing format.

Key Features

Responsive Portfolio: A single-page website detailing my experience, education, and projects (including Zero Trust Architecture and Data Analytics).

Stylized Resume: A dedicated Resume.html document using a warm, autumnal color palette for high readability.

AI Chatbot: An interactive feature on the main page that allows users (recruiters, managers) to ask specific questions about my background using natural language.

Getting Started

Since this project uses only static HTML, CSS (via Tailwind CDN), and client-side JavaScript, it is extremely easy to run.

Local Setup

Clone the Repository:

git clone 
cd 


Open in Browser: Simply open the main file in your web browser.

open index.html


View Resume: The separate Resume.html file is linked from the navigation menu.

Important Note about the Chatbot

The AI Chatbot requires a deployed companion backend service to function. If you are running this locally, the bot is configured to connect to the active backend service endpoint. If the chat feature is not working, it usually means the external service is down or the endpoint URL needs updating.
